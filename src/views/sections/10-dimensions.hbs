        <h2>Canvases and 2D space</h2>
        <p>The IIIF Presentation API isn't just for images. So far we have looked at 2D
            canvases. The current IIIF Presentation API has supported 2D canvases right from
            the start. While we can annotate time-based media (audio and video) onto a 2D
            Canvas in space, in exactly the same way we position images and text onto the
            canvas using the coordinate system, the current published specification doesn't
            allow us to annotate images, text, video, audio and other content onto the
            canvas at a particular point in time, because a Canvas has no duration, no
            concept of a time dimension to accompany the width and height. If we add a time
            dimension, it allows us to annotate in both space and time:

        </p>
        
        <p>
            And also, we can have a Canvas that has only a duration, no width or height -
            onto which we could annotate audio tracks. The same model accommodates this.

            In the future, the model may also accommodate 3D or 3D time-based media - but the
            focus for this year is to make the model work well for AV, just as it does for
            image and text content.
