        <h2>The IIIF Presentation API</h2>
        <p><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5812589?v=3&s=200" style="float:left; margin-right:20px;" /> The
            IIIF Presentation API avoids this problem by being very clear about what it is for. It's not concerned with descriptive
            metadata. It has no opinion about whether a painting has an author. Its job is to convey an object for presentation.
            This means getting pixels on screen to drive a viewer, or offering a surface for annotation. The model is about
            <b>presentation semantics</b> rather than descriptive semantics. The descriptive metadata won't help
            us paint the pixels on the screen so that we can read the pages, look at the brush strokes or see the film grain.
            Instead we need information about the images, audio, video, text and other content so we can display it, search
            it, reuse it; we need information about the structure of the object to navigate it; and we need information about
            pagination, orientation, reading direction and other hints at how to present the content. We also need links
            off to other sources of data that can help humans and machines make sense of the object if they choose to follow
            them, such as web pages or catalogue records.</p>

        <p>The IIIF Presentation API provides:
            <ul>
                <li>A model for describing digital representations of objects: <i>"Just enough metadata to drive a remote viewing
                    experience"</i>
                </li>
                <li>A format for software - viewing tools, annotation clients, web sites - to consume and render the objects
                    and any other associated content in the form of annotations
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Just enough for presentation</h2>
        <p>This doesn't mean that the descriptive metadata has no place in a digital object delivered by the Presentation API.
            It's important that the object is accompanied by useful information, and links to other descriptions of the object.
            The Presentation API takes great care to ensure that you can accompany your digital objects with rich human-readable
            descriptions, with support for multiple languages, so that viewers can display that important contextual information
            to users. It also provides an explicit mechanism for linking to one or more semantic descriptions of the object
            depicted, as well as related human-readable resources. There's quite a bit of descriptive metadata being presented
            here:

        </p>

        <p>For the Presentation API, the meaning of any accompanying descriptive metadata for display in a viewer is irrelevant.
            The API's job is to get the content of the work - the pages of the book, the painting - to a point where a human
            can interact with it in a logical way. To view it, read it, annotate it, mix it up with other things if they
            want. A IIIF client can also display any accompanying metadata included as multilingual pairs of labels and values.
            But that's as far as it goes, it needs no definition or scheme for what that metadata means. It is
            <i>outside of the scope</i> of the Presentation API. In the screen shot above, the user can <i>view</i> important
            semantic metadata - but the Presentation API is just a conduit for that text. In the Presentation API, those
            strings have no semantic significance. They are not defined in the specification. A client of the API should
            just render them. If you want to know what they mean, look at the link to descriptive metadata that a publisher
            of IIIF resources provides.</p>

        <p>This means that the Presentation API is <i>not</i> a new metadata standard to describe your objects. It is not an
            alternative to or replacement for any existing descriptive metadata standards, because it has a different function.
            The many rich and various ways in which different communities describe objects are diverse for good reason. The
            models a community or an individual institution adopt to describe the meaning of its objects in the world, from
            cataloguing schemes to APIs, benefit from shared vocabularies and common practice within large communities, but
            attempts at complete standardisation fail and are not even desirable. The models, standards and APIs an institution
            adopts for description are an expression of its view of the world. However, while it is not reasonable or desirable
            that everyone describes their objects the same way semantically, it is desirable that an insitution <i>presents</i>            its objects via a common standard. Many descriptive standards, one Presentation standard - for the same reason
            that it is sensible to make your web pages compatible with most web browsers.</p>

        <p>This does not mean that the user experience driven by the Presentation API has to be standard as well; far from it.
            IIIF is not about standardising the user experience. An object described by the Presentation API could be rendered
            by a conventional bookreader style viewer, loaded into a scholarly workbench application for annotation, displayed
            as an explosion of thumbnails, projected into a virtual space, rendered as minimalist web pages, remixed into
            multimedia presentations, worked into online exhibitions, reused in physical gallery space or turned into games
            and interactive experiences. The Presentation API model encourages creative re-use of the content, and to this
            end ensures it stays separate from the descriptive metadata. A Presentation API resource is portable, reusable
            and interoperable. If you have a digitised resource, you provide a Presentation API resource and a semantic description
            of the object, and the two link to each other.
